Hi, everyone. I've decided we need to make some changes to the cover of "Business
Success", the book we are scheduled to send the client for confirmation. I am looking for
your ideas about how to improve the cover, so please email them to me by the end of the day.

Directions: Respond to the email as if you are an editor. In your email to Megan Plume,
make at least THREE suggestions.

Dear Mrs. Megan Plume,

I'm really sorry for the late response. I have spent a week thinking about some possible
ideas for the "Business Success" cover.

Firstly, a line which illustrates a growing pattern can be the primary object of the cover.
Every entrepreneur always wants to lead their business to success, and the increasing
tendency in sales and prestige proves that. The color theme includes yellow, purple and red.
The background is in dark purple, the line is in yellow, and the name of the book which stays
obove the line is red.

Another idea is adding yellow coins and green paper money for the cover. Notebly, the
coins and paper money must be drawn specially in order to create a dropping effect. The 
name of the book can be designed in white and the background is in dark purple.

The last idea is a classic. The picture of the author is placed on the right side of the cover
and the name of the book is on the left. The author is a familiar business man so it will
increase the sale of the book relatively.

Sincerely,
Chloe Jane.
