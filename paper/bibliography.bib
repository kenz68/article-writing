  Abstract                 = {The frequency moments of a sequence containingmielements of typei, 1⩽i⩽n, are the numbersFk=∑ni=1 mki. We consider the space complexity of randomized algorithms that approximate the numbersFk, when the elements of the sequence are given one by one and cannot be stored. Surprisingly, it turns out that the numbersF0,F1, andF2can be approximated in logarithmic space, whereas the approximation ofFkfork⩾6 requiresnΩ(1)space. Applications to data bases are mentioned as well. },

Furthermore, the resemblance can be evaluated using a fixed size sample for each document. This paper discusses the mathematical properties of these measures and the efficient implementation of the sampling process using Rabin (1981) fingerprints},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating the number of distinct values is a fundamental problem in database that has attracted extensive research over the past two decades, due to its wide applications (especially in the Internet). Many algorithms have been proposed via sampling or sketching for obtaining statistical estimates that only require limited computing and memory resources. However, their performance in terms of relative estimation accuracy usually depends on the unknown cardinalities. In this paper, we address the following question: can a distinct counting algorithm have uniformly reliable performance, i.e. constant relative estimation errors for unknown cardinalities in a wide range, say from tens to millions? We propose a self-learning bitmap algorithm (S-bitmap) to answer this question. The S-bitmap is a bitmap obtained via a novel adaptive sampling process, where the bits corresponding to the sampled items are set to 1, and the sampling rates are learned from the number of distinct items already passed and reduced sequentially as more bits are set to 1. A unique property of S-bitmap is that its relative estimation error is truly stabilized, i.e. invariant to unknown cardinalities in a prescribed range. We demonstrate through both theoretical and empirical studies that with a given memory requirement, S-bitmap is not only uniformly reliable but more accurate than state-of-the-art algorithms such as the multiresolution bitmap and Hyper LogLog algorithms under common practice settings.},

We present a statistical analysis of probabilistic counting algorithms, focusing on two techniques that use pseudo-random variates to form low-dimensional data sketches. We apply conventional statistical methods to compare probabilistic algorithms based on storing either selected order statistics, or random projections. We derive estimators of the cardinality in both cases, and show that the maximal-term estimator is recursively computable and has exponentially decreasing error bounds. Furthermore, we show that the estimators have comparable asymptotic efficiency, and explain this result by demonstrating an unexpected connection between the two approaches.},

We show that any one-pass streaming algorithm for (ε, δ)-approximating F0 must use Ω(1/ε2) space when ε = Ω(m-1(9 + k)/), for any k > 0, improving upon the known lower bound of Ω(1/ε) for this range of ε. This lower bound is tight up to a factor of log log m for small ε and log 1/ε for large ε. Our lower bound is derived from a reduction from the one-way communication complexity of approximating a Boolean function in Euclidean space. The reduction makes use of a low-distortion embedding from an l2 to l1 norm.},

  Abstract                 = {In combinatorics and analysis of algorithms a Poisson version of a problem (henceforth called Poisson model or poissonization) is often easier to solve than the original one, which we name here the Bernoulli model. Poissonization is a technique that replaces the original input (e.g., think of balls thrown into urns) by a Poisson process (e.g., think of balls arriving according to a Poisson process into urns). More precisely, analytical Poisson transform maps a sequence (e.g., characterizing the Bernoulli model) into a generating function of a complex variable. However, after poissonization one must depoissonize in order to translate the results of the Poisson model into the original (i.e., Bernoulli) model. We present in this paper several analytical depoissonization results that fall into the following general scheme: If the Poisson transform has an appropriate growth in the complex plane, then an asymptotic expansion of the sequence can be expressed in terms of the Poisson transform and its derivatives evaluated on the real line. Not surprisingly, actual formulations of depoissonization results depend on the nature of the growth of the Poisson transform, and thus we have polynomial and exponential depoissonization theorems. Normalization (e.g., as in the central limit theorem) introduces another twist that led us to formulate the so-called diagonal depoissonization theorems. Finally, we illustrate our results on numerous examples from combinatorics and the analysis of algorithms and data structures (e.g., combinatorial assemblies, digital trees, multiaccess protocols, probabilistic counting, selecting a leader, data compression, etc.).},
