## 1. What is _Go_ and why was it created?
**Go**, also referred to as **Golang**, is an open-source programming language developed by a team at Google and make available to the public in 2009. The design of Go is influenced by its renowned creators: **Rob Pike**, **Ken Thompson**, and **Robert Griesemer**.

The language aimed to address specific challenges experienced by Google developers, and also sought to amalgamate the best features from different languages.

### Key Objectives of Go's Design
- **Simplicity**: Go was designed with a minimalistic approach to minimize complexity. Its design steers clear of excessive abstraction and programmer 'magic'.
- **Efficiency**: It was crucial for Go to by efficient and expressive in both time and space.
- **Safety**: The creators aimed to make Go a safe, statically-type language.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Go's design intends to make concurrent programming pragmatic and straightforward. This was achieved, to a great extent,through features such as **goroutines** and **channels**.
- **Being a System Language**: Go was envisioned as a language suitable for system-level programming. This means it is feasible to use Go to create operating systems, write device drivers, or handle system operations.

### Key Features
- **Open Source**: Go is open source, which means its source code is openly available. You can view, modify, and distribute it under license's terms.
- **Statiscally Type**: Like Java and C++, Go requires you to specify types of variables and function return values explicitly. These types are checked at compile-time for safety and accuracy.
- **Memory Management**: Go developers don't have deal with low-level memory operations like C/C++. Instead, Go use a **garbage collector** to release memory from objects that aren't in use.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Go directly supports **concurrent** operations through the use of **goroutines** and **channels**.
- **In-Built Toolset**: Go comes with numerous tools, such as the `go` command-line tool, that automates many development tasks. For instance, you can use `go build` to compile your program and `go test` to run your tests.
- **Portability**: Go was designed to be compatible with multiple systems and architectures.
- **Unicode Support**: Go is thoroughly _Unicode_-compliant.
- **Support for Networking**: Go comes with libraries to handle network operations efficiently, making it an optimum language for developing network systems.

### Who Uses Go?
Several prominent companies make extensive use of Go in critical, performance-driven systems, such as:
- **Google**: Go is offen used in internal systems, and many cloud services like Youtube, Google Search, and others heavily rely on Go for thier backend tasks.
- **Dropbox**: Dropbox has employed Go to enhance performance in software components that require synchronization and other tasks.
- **Docker**: Go plays a key part in enabling Docker to achive cross-platform compatibility and resource efficiency.
- **SoundCloud**: SoundCloud has utilized Go for deploying and managing thier infrastructure.
- **BBC Worldwide**: Go is instrumental in enabling real-time data processing for BBC Worldwide, ensuring viewers recieve the most current content.
Beyond these, Go is increasingly favoured for cloud-native applications and microservices due to its performance, efficiency in resource management, and robust standard library. This popularity is forecasted to grow as more companies recognize the advantages Go bring to the table.
